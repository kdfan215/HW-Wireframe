            My name is Ryan Braudo and I am 23 years old. I graduated from
            California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo with a
            B.S. in Business Administration June 2018. After graduating I
            decided I wanted to work in the hospitality industry. Apparently,
            the industry only wants people with experience for entry-level jobs.
            I love dogs and ended up getting a job at a doggie hotel and worked
            there for six months. I enjoyed it but the pay was horrendous so it
            did not work out. I applied for other hospitality jobs for the last
            6 months unsuccessfully. That is how I ended up here! I wanted to
            learn an in-demand skill that will help me no matter the industry.
            In my spare time I watch NBA basketball. My favorite player is Kevin
            Durant and my favorite team is the Lakers. I love playing videogames
            especially Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption 2. I have two
            dogs named Bentley and Roscoe. They are good boys. Usually.
